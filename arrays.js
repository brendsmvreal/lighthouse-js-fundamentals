// properties = special pieces of information about a data structure 
const myArray = [2, false, "bye", true, "hi", 6];
console.log(myArray.length); // output: 6 - meaning, it counted how many elements we have stored in the array

//methods ie
reverse // reverses the order of the elements in an array 
sort // sorts the elements in an array
push & pop // two methods that allow us to add and remove elements from an array 
push // adds an element at the end of the array - will be the last index of the array
pop // will remove the last element of the array -  the last index - it also returns the element that has been removed 
splice // adds and removes elements from anywhere within an array - lets you specify the index location to add new elements - as well as the number of elements you'd like to delete (if any) - agr1 mandatory > specifies the starting index position to add/remove elements
